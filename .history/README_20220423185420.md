# Jenkins
This repository is for Jenkins
[https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/](https://jenkins.io/doc/tutorials/build-a-java-app-with-maven/)
tutorial in the [Jenkins User Documentation](https://jenkins.io/doc/).

The repository contains a simple Java application which outputs the string
"Hello world!" and is accompanied by a couple of unit tests to check that the
main application works as expected. The results of these tests are saved to a
JUnit XML report.

The `jenkins` directory contains an example of the `Jenkinsfile` (i.e. Pipeline)
created myself and the `scripts` subdirectory
contains a shell script with commands that are executed when Jenkins processes
the "Deliver" stage of your Pipeline.
